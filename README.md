E-Diagnostics App

This repository contains the source code for a web-based diagnostics application built using Flask. The application enables users to input their symptoms and receive potential diagnoses based on machine learning algorithms. It also features user registration, login, and a dashboard for viewing personalized information. Additionally, it includes a central table for storing and accessing user diagnoses, which can be analyzed using Power BI for data visualization and insights.

Features:
- User registration and login functionality
- Symptom input and diagnosis prediction using the mode of random forest, decision tree, SVC, KNN, and Naive Bayes machine learning algorithms
- Dashboard for users to access their information
- Central table for storing user diagnoses
- Integration with Power BI for data visualization

Technologies used: Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Power BI

Feel free to contribute to the development of this diagnostics application and improve its features. Your contributions are welcome and appreciated.
